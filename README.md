# odin-recipes

This project gives a basic demostration of HTML by making a recipes website. It may cover things such as header heiarchy, basic text manipulation and emphasis, and similar topics. THe plan is to later return and pretty it up by adding CSS. I hypothesize this will be by attaching a .css file and adding the code connecting it in the html file.
